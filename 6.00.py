# A computer does two things
    # 1. It perform calculations and 
    # 2. It remember the results of those calculations.
# All the knowledge can be thought of as declarative or imperative.
# Declarative knowledge is composed of statements of fact.
# Imperative knowledge is "how to" knowlege, or a recipes for deducing information.
# Sequence of steps + flow of control = algorithm.
# It is possible for computer to program itself.
# Both data and program a computer manipulates resides in memory.
# A program counter points to a particular location in memory and computation starts by executing the instruction at that point.
